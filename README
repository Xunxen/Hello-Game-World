This game is intended as an exercise in game programming for a beginner programmer.

For those wishing to use it to further their own skills beware, as I have absolutely no comments in my code.
those wishing to play this simple game, the controls are arrow keys to move and select menu options, esc to pause, and enter to select a highlighted menu option.
A few things may not work quite right yet, as only the Player class uses insets other than the top, so anyone not using a mac may notice the Player can go a bit off-screen at the sides and bottom. I intend to fix this soon. very soon...
